# Evidence relating to theft of valuable stamps

This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the theft of valuable stamps.

Regarding the theft of valuable stamps, Tracy and Pat had communicated with each other through SMS and email. Pat sent a message about needing PDF’s for certain documents and Tracy had sent another zip file that was not password-protected like the original. In the zip file contained three PDF files of stamp insurances.

The following figures are images of stamps that were found in Tracy’s phone gallery that coincide with the stamps mentioned in the insurance documents.

Hence, from the evidence that we have collected, we can assume that Tracy was an accomplice in Pat’s plan to steal the stamps that were documented for insurance assurance by the National Gallery.

# Evidence relating to defacement of museum art

This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the defacement of museum art.

Tracy communicated with Carry as well about holding a flash mob event. Based on the given information about the case, this flashmob was used as a distraction for King Kthings for the heist to be successful. Carry requested for her tablet to bypass security through email which Tracy agreed to.

From this evidence, we can assume that Tracy acted as an accomplice for Pat’s and Carry’s plans that involved the defacement of art.
