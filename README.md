# Evidence relating to theft of valuable stamps

This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the theft of valuable stamps.

Regarding the theft of valuable stamps, Tracy and Pat had communicated with each other through SMS and email. Pat sent a message about needing PDF’s for certain documents and Tracy had sent another zip file that was not password-protected like the original. In the zip file contained three PDF files of stamp insurances.

The following figures are images of stamps that were found in Tracy’s phone gallery that coincide with the stamps mentioned in the insurance documents.

# Evidence relating to defacement of museum art

This sub-section provides details regarding the evidence found as it relates to the defacement of museum art.
